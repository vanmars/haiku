# _Haiku Checker/Creator_

#### _Application that checks whether a poem is in fact a haiku_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

_This is an exercise for Epicodus to practice functional programming techniques. The original instructions incude:_

A haiku is a poem that consists of three lines. The first has five syllables, the second has seven, and the third has five. Start by creating an application that checks whether a poem is in fact a haiku. If you have time, build out your application so that it can randomly generate haikus.

Your logic should verify that the poem has three lines.
Your logic should verify English syllable rules (and exceptions) one at a time. A quick Google search will provide information on English syllable rules.
If you successfully complete a Haiku checker, continue to build out your application to randomly generate haikus.
Make sure you test your application for each new rule you implement.
